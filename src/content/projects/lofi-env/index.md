_Glorious pixel art done by my awesome partner_

Ahh, probably the first project I actually completed. I was (and still am) super in love with the lofi concept and pixel art. Merging these two together was a no-brainer.

This project initially started off as just a basic frontend with all the core features like the timer, sounds, lofi radio, and to-do list. These were all things I built separately in my initial dabbles in frontend development. During my time as an intern at a start up, they challenged me to extend the project into a full-stack application with authentication and persistence. I guess this was their way of "training" me. Don't get me wrong, it was quite effective.

I remember not even knowing how to write a basic REST endpoint. It was definitely a grindy few weeks, but I pulled through eventually and even impressed myself with what I could do in such a short time. It goes to show that some sense of accountability really drives results.

As my first baby, I treasured this project and used it for years to come when I needed to be productive with some cozy tunes.
