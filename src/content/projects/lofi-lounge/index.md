_Cozy lofi radio with even more pixel art selections_

I really loved [lofi-env](/projects/lofi-env) don't get me wrong, but I felt as if it needed some immersive visuals to go with the cozy environment. Lofi and pixels had another baby and named it âœ¨ Lofi Lounge âœ¨.

I undertook this project to learn more about a state management library we were using at work called [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html). I was also curious what [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) had to offer for animations, and it definitely delivered.

I had too much fun building this, and unlike its [older sibling](/projects/lofi-env), it's actually mobile responsive!
